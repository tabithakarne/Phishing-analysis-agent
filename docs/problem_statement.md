## Problem Statement

Phishing emails remain one of the most common attack vectors,
leading to credential theft, financial fraud, and malware delivery.

Many users lack the ability to identify:
- Spoofed sender domains
- Urgent manipulation tactics
- Malicious links
- Social engineering language

This project defines an AI-driven analysis agent that evaluates
emails using structured security prompts and classifies risk.
